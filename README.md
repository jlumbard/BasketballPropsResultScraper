This project explores the relationship between team and player popularity and the relative profitability of beting on said teams or players. 
While understanding that sportsbooks want to manage risk on their website, one can imagine that teams that are less likely to be bet on are often more profitable, in the bookmaker's attempt to balance their risk

Therefore, proxying popularity with social media followings, can one profitably bet on certain teams or players? 

The answer seems to be yes for teams and no for players.
